This project involves the analysis of genomic data extracted from the Stanford HGDP SNP Genotyping Database, specifically focusing on chromosome 6 (chr6) in individuals of European descent (H938 Euro). The primary goal is to explore the genetic variation and population structure using advanced computational and statistical methods.
